    <p>This query works by finding the number of years between the SQL Server’s base date (January 1, 1900) and the current date using DATEDIFF. It then adds one to this value to get next year, and uses DATEADD to find the first day of that year. The result is a date value representing the first day of the next year. Please note that this query is specific to SQL Server. If you’re using a different SQL dialect, the syntax might vary.</p>
